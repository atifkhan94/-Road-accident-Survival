# -Road-accident-Survival
This project focuses on predicting the survival chances of individuals involved in road accidents using machine learning models. By analyzing various factors like vehicle type, speed, seatbelt usage, and emergency response time, we aim to develop a predictive model that can assist emergency responders and policymakers in reducing fatalities.
